# TDF Weekly Progress Reports
## Hey, I'm Meghana (Megzu) ðŸŒ»
### Iâ€™m maintaining this journal to document my process through the Technology Design Foundation class, which is a mix of electronics and digital fabrication. Very excited to learn, experiment, and do fun stuff along the way!
# Week 1  | 02.09.2025 - 09.09.2025 
## Electronics ðŸ”Œ
In the first week, we were introduced to the syllabus and the general direction of TDF. I am in the Directed section with Prof. Sudhu Tewari and Chris Mayers, where the emphasis is on creating feasible things over simply visible or desirable ones, a refreshing shift in perspective. We received our toolkits, which was really exciting and made the course feel tangible right from the start. Although Iâ€™ve previously overseen projects that involved microcontrollers and electronics. Prof. Tewari also shared useful resources for brushing up on Arduino basics, which Iâ€™ve started exploring.

## Experiments
1. Built-in Blink: I ran the classic blink sketch that makes the onboard LED at pin 13 turn on and off every second.
2. External LED Blink: I connected an LED to pin 8 with a resistor and made it blink at one-second intervals, similar to the built-in LED.
``` int externalLED = 8;   // external LED connected to pin 8

void setup() {
  pinMode(externalLED, OUTPUT);  // set pin 8 as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(externalLED, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
  delay(1000);                      // wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(externalLED, LOW);   // turn LED OFF
  delay(1000);                      // wait 1 second
} ```
3. Built-in + External Blink: Tried to connect both at the same time and it worked.

## Assignment - Hello World with LED Blinking

``` int ledPin = 13;  // Built-in LED on pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);     // Set LED pin as output
  Serial.begin(9600);          // Start serial communication at 9600 baud
}

void loop() {
  // Turn LED ON
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  Serial.println("Hello World! LED is ON");
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second

  // Turn LED OFF
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  Serial.println("Hello World! LED is OFF");
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second
} ```
