# Week 1   
## Electronics üîå| 02.09.2025 - 09.09.2025
In the first week, we were introduced to the syllabus and the general direction of TDF. I am in the Directed section with Prof. Sudhu Tewari and Chris Mayers, where the emphasis is on creating feasible things over simply visible or desirable ones, a refreshing shift in perspective. We received our toolkits, which was really exciting and made the course feel tangible right from the start. Although I‚Äôve previously overseen projects that involved microcontrollers and electronics. Prof. Tewari also shared useful resources for brushing up on Arduino basics, which I‚Äôve started exploring.

### Experiments
1. Built-in Blink: I ran the classic blink sketch that makes the onboard LED at pin 13 turn on and off every second.
2. External LED Blink: I connected an LED to pin 8 with a resistor and made it blink at one-second intervals, similar to the built-in LED.
``` int externalLED = 8;   // external LED connected to pin 8

void setup() {
  pinMode(externalLED, OUTPUT);  // set pin 8 as output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(externalLED, HIGH);  // turn LED ON
  delay(1000);                      // wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(externalLED, LOW);   // turn LED OFF
  delay(1000);                      // wait 1 second
}
```
3. Built-in + External Blink: Tried to connect both at the same time and it worked.


### Assignment - Hello World with LED Blinking

``` int ledPin = 13;  // Built-in LED on pin 13

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);     // Set LED pin as output
  Serial.begin(9600);          // Start serial communication at 9600 baud
}

void loop() {
  // Turn LED ON
  digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  Serial.println("Hello World! LED is ON");
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second

  // Turn LED OFF
  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  Serial.println("Hello World! LED is OFF");
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second
}
```

## Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è | 04.09.2025 - 11.09.2025
In the first week of digital fabrication, we were introduced to the **laser cutter**. Chris Mayers gave us a training session on how to properly operate the equipment. We covered not only what to do but, most importantly, what *not* to do when handling the machine. Safety and precision were key themes, which helped set the tone for how powerful and delicate this tool can be.  

### Assignment - Personality Ring
For our first assignment, we were asked to experiment with **Adobe Illustrator** and design a ring that reflects our personality. When I first came here, I was told to ‚Äúgo fly.‚Äù That thought stayed with me, and I wanted to create wings. But then I imagined something more playful, the blades of a helicopter! That idea shaped my experiment, and I began designing a small hand-held spinning toy.

#### Iteration 1
I quickly sketched a drawing of a large fan-like structure with three blades and a central hole.  
The design included a ring with a pointed extrusion on top to pass through the blades, and a stopper to hold it in place.  
After making the first prototype, I realized:
- The blades were too long ‚Äî uncomfortable to wear on the hand.  
- The blades were too thin ‚Äî prone to breakage.  
- The ring fit was loose.  
- A single ring wasn‚Äôt strong enough to support the structure.  
- The projection on the ring was too short to hold the cap securely.  
*(I also struggled with the software a little, but with help from buddies and Chris, I managed to get it done.)*

<p><img src="WhatsApp Image 2025-09-11 at 12.51.49.jpeg"></p>

#### Iteration 2
To improve the design:
- Decreased the diameter of the ring for a tighter fit.  
- Added a second ring to stack together for stability.  
- Increased the height of the projection on the ring so the stopper could hold properly.  
- Reduced the length of the blades to make it more wearable.

<p><img src="WhatsApp Image 2025-09-11 at 12.51.43.jpeg"></p>

#### Iteration 3 (Final!)
In the last version:
- Decreased the blade length even further.  
- Gave the blades a slight curved edge for smoother motion.  
- Sanded the whole piece for a clean finish.

And *yayy!* my cute little fidget toy was ready to fly.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad9a2e65-1eec-4ec5-87cb-d4c90dae7514

It fits perfectly on the hand, turns smoothly, and feels like a playful blend of wings and helicopter blades. Here are the 3 genz together!

# Week 2  
## Electronics üîå | 09.09.2025 - 16.09.2025 
In Week 2, we followed tutorials in class and were introduced to using an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor along with an RGB LED (3-in-1). It was exciting to see how the RGB LED could mix colors based on sensor input, opening up creative ways to play with light and interactivity. Later, I experimented on my own with a few variations, trying out different sensor responses and LED patterns, which gave me a better grasp of how analog inputs can control multi-channel outputs.

### Classwork

## Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è | 11.09.2025 - 18.09.2025

In the second week, we moved from 2D to 3D by learning Fusion 360. This was my very first time using the software, so it took some time to get comfortable, but it opened up new ways to think about form and structure.

### Assignment

We had two assignments this week.

1. Recreate the personality ring in 3D ‚Äî I modified my helicopter blades slightly, and once printed, the ring spun so smoothly.

# Week 3  

## Electronics üîå+ Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è | 16.09.2025 - 18.09.2025 

In class this week, we learned how to use a servo motor. First, I made it move back and forth on its own with a simple program. Then, we connected a knob (potentiometer) so that turning it could change the angle of the servo. It was fun to see how something I controlled by hand could directly move the motor showing how inputs and outputs can work together.

```
#include <Servo.h>

Servo myservo;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);  // servo signal on pin 9
}

void loop() {
  // sweep from 0 to 180
  for (int pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos++) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);   // adjust for speed
  }

  // sweep back from 180 to 0
  for (int pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos--) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
}
```

We were also introduced to our project brief on emotive origami. In class, we practiced a few simple folds with paper and cardboard, and were shown some example videos of what‚Äôs possible. For my first test, I tried folding a flying bird to check the quality of the paper I chose and to see how much motion I could create. This was my starting point for exploring how movement and form can work together.

# Week 4  

## Electronics üîå + Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è| 18.09.2025 - 25.09.2025 

### Process

For the project, I began by exploring a few origami folds, using reference books and YouTube tutorials for guidance. I eventually chose the hyperbolic paraboloid, which has both a personal and technical significance for me. It connects back to the Param science center, a building I worked on earlier and still hold close to my heart. Mathematically, it‚Äôs a fascinating form where strength comes from geometry rather than mass, making it a sustainable and efficient structure.
![PXL_20250920_190441859 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/309a77d6-fd72-4b58-89e0-32d715a56ede)
![PXL_20250922_234249056 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d070a2c5-518d-4afc-b5c2-fd6bc587941e)
![PXL_20250923_033931478 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8222e99-bd7f-4ab3-b871-d7750728d86f)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4fe48b1-13bd-4408-82ba-4066547ed957


I first folded paper models to understand the geometry and then started thinking about how to animate the form. My initial idea was to create a two-way 180¬∞ twisting motion, but after sketches and discussions with Cody and Chris, I realized it would be mechanically complex. I then shifted the idea to a horizontal sliding motion along the X-axis.

![ideation sketch 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18c8f3a3-9d5b-422a-990b-8274cc566e14)
![ideation sketch 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0a60355-57d0-4465-b305-7332c6263323)

Below are the 2 other motions that I tried out before arriving at the final one.

### Iterations

Rack & Pinion Setup ‚Äì With Lauryn‚Äôs suggestion, I tried using a rack and pinion to move the piece. I 3D-printed a set and attempted to mesh it with the motor. Nikhil helped me out with this!
![PXL_20250924_055455343](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d5e026-7ce8-4617-ab93-bf22f255e47b)
![PXL_20250924_033406082](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7058a90e-1e2a-4a1f-8f46-3ec948bca196)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b03078-6c7e-4f21-907e-a0d6de007831

Materials - For prototyping, I used simple materials like pens, paper clips, and scrap laser-cut circles to quickly test connections and motions before moving to sturdier setups.
Once the idea felt promising, I mounted the system inside a cardboard box, cutting a diagonal slit to hold the form. Two bamboo skewers were attached to adjacent sides of the shape‚Äîone fixed inside the box and the other connected to the rack‚Äîso that only one side would move.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c09a88-2f78-4cb1-bc2b-aba8e85fff56

Guiding Tracks ‚Äì The rack kept slipping, so I added two wooden sticks as rails to keep the motion straight.
![PXL_20250925_162652009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a93ea983-1925-4414-925e-7cd35829956d)
Final Working Model ‚Äì With some duct tape fixes and funny little add-ons, I managed to get the piece moving smoothly.

### Challenges & Learnings

- The first challenge was purely mechanical‚Äîgetting the motion smooth and consistent.
- Simple adjustments (like slits, tape, or skewers) can make the difference between a stuck system and one that moves smoothly.
- The next challenge came from the coding side. The sweep code and LDR sensor code didn‚Äôt seem to work together, and the serial monitor kept showing a value of 0.
- Eventually, I used ChatGPT to generate an alternative code, which worked. Roopa helped me out with this! That moment of seeing the mechanism finally move felt amazing.
- Coding is never one-and-done; debugging is part of the process, and exploring alternative solutions often opens up new directions.

### Reflections
Presenting the working prototype in class, especially with the golden hour shots, was rewarding‚Äîit felt like my first proper breakthrough in this project.

![PXL_20250926_001851614 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0063d49-27d9-4931-8485-f530a291aeb6)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac54ac85-e233-4e25-b6e1-35feb3123039

While this prototype gave me the satisfaction of solving mechanical and coding issues, I still feel drawn to my initial idea of creating a full motion. I want to revisit that direction in future iterations, exploring a more natural and expressive movement. This week showed me the joy of ‚Äúmaking it work,‚Äù but I also want to push myself!

# Week 6
# 28.09.2025 - 04.10.2025
### Overview
This week, we were introduced to our next project ‚Äî Expressive Mechanics. The goal was to design a kinetic mechanism that could interact with camera input, making it responsive and expressive through movement. It was an exciting shift, blending physical motion with digital sensing.
## Electronics üîå
This week‚Äôs electronics sessions introduced us to open programming and p5.js ‚Äî both completely new to me. I started experimenting in class, playing around with some simple sketches and creating a few cute illustrations.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e75d41f-cfca-45ed-a201-195a26d48f70

![PXL_20251001_011442116 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bedb0c4-e525-4a87-84ac-9b5f151fc02b)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e9a44b2-6f26-4bd0-90b0-f71cabe7c4a7

We also learned how to integrate a potentiometer with p5.js and serial communication, making physical input control digital visuals. It was quite interesting to see how turning a small knob could bring motion and interactivity to the screen.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3524af56-ce84-4e64-a1d0-57aeee1c1d08

## Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è

I was inspired by some of the examples shown in class but wanted to understand the process by building something from scratch rather than replicating existing designs.
![PXL_20251001_012030688 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97fe6714-b5ad-4dbc-bcde-b9adbeb011ab)

I began by 3D printing a cam mechanism found online to study how the parts interact, but the attempt wasn‚Äôt successful ‚Äî the components fused together due to adhesive issues and couldn‚Äôt move as intended. It was a useful learning experience in understanding tolerances and assembly techniques.
![PXL_20251004_175119554 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d18c47-15a5-4b3e-bab1-85c5cbe5317c)

After that, I decided to explore the umbrella mechanism, intrigued by its simple yet effective motion. I studied a few reference videos and began designing a laser-cut version. I found and 3D printed a few versions of a six-connector hub to test with quarter-inch dowels available in the studio, but the fittings didn‚Äôt align properly. I plan to refine these connections and continue developing the system next week.

# Week 7
# 05.10.2025 - 11.10.2025
## Overview ‚òÇÔ∏è
By this week, I had a clear idea of what I wanted to accomplishm, a linkage mechanism that opens and closes in the air like an umbrella, held together at the center by a rod. The setup involved two hubs: one fixed at the top of the stick and another movable one that would slide along it.
The concept was to create an interactive system where the default state on screen shows a bright, daylight scene. When the camera detects a person‚Äôs face, a rain animation would play, simultaneously triggering the umbrella mechanism to open, symbolizing the connection between human presence and environmental change.

## Digital Fabrication üõ†Ô∏è
I focused on laser-cutting and prototyping the linkage arms and hinge mechanism. I began by sketching and testing the geometry in Illustrator, then iterated through three rounds of laser cutting to achieve the correct lengths and motion range.
![PXL_20251006_220430589 MP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68657b9b-b7ff-4c6e-8b59-35ce41258330)

I made six sets of linkages and assembled them, keeping the system modular really helped during testing. In parallel, I also laser-cut a box structure to support the mechanism and keep it upright during assembly and testing.

Soon, I realized that the hub needed to be designed precisely for my setup rather than using a generic one from online sources. So, I modeled it in Fusion 360.

But of course, the first print didn‚Äôt go as planned ‚Äî I hadn‚Äôt accounted for 3D printing shrinkage, so the center hole wasn‚Äôt wide enough. To make things worse, the screw holes on the sides didn‚Äôt align with the laser-cut linkages (another silly mistake!). After some advice and help from a friend, I redesigned the part more accurately, and finally, on the third 3D print, it worked perfectly. With a little sanding on the rod (thanks to Chris‚Äôs tip on how to smooth it properly), the hub fit beautifully, and the mechanism started functioning as intended.

At this stage, I hadn‚Äôt yet considered the motor aspect, which I now realize I should have planned earlier. I decided to use a servo with a rack-and-pinion setup, similar to my first project ‚Äî but this time with stronger rails and better fixtures. Unfortunately, I hadn‚Äôt designed it specifically for this setup, which led to several challenges with gear alignment and keeping the system stable at a consistent height. A frustrating but valuable learning experience.

## Electronics üîå
For the electronics part of this project, I used a servo motor connected to a gear to drive the umbrella‚Äôs motion. Initially, I used the base code shared by Prof Sudhu, but I struggled for quite some time because I was running it in a different p5.js link. Only later did I realize that the library HTML files were preloaded in his link, which is why the code worked there and not in mine. Lesson learned.

After sorting that out, I used ChatGPT to write a few variations of the code and animation. In the first version, the system reacted backward, it started raining when I moved far away and turned into daylight when I came closer. Fixing this logic took a bit of tweaking.

Then came another issue: the servo motor was moving abruptly from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞ instead of transitioning smoothly. Adjusting the motion speed and delay finally made the umbrella open gracefully.

For the final setup, I added a cute animation of a person walking with a stick (representing the umbrella). When someone comes close to the screen, it starts raining, and the person on screen raises the stick ‚Äî mimicking the action of opening an umbrella, which simultaneously triggers the real kinetic umbrella mechanism behind the laptop.\

## Reflection üí≠

Keeping the setup modular turned out to be extremely helpful ‚Äî it allowed me to troubleshoot one part at a time. Working with a simple mechanism but refining it thoroughly taught me the importance of precision over complexity.

If I were to redo this project, I‚Äôd spend more time designing each part to fit together precisely, instead of relying on tape or glue for quick fixes ‚Äî they‚Äôre very ad hoc and end up wasting time. Overall, this project helped me better understand how to link physical and digital motion meaningfully. Also the aspect of storytelling worked out well!

# Week 8
# 12.10.2025 - 18.10.2025
## Overview 
This week, we were introduced to the Ambient Display Project, which focuses on creating subtle, interactive displays that respond to environmental or personal data. In class, we saw several examples of quick 3D printing prototypes and other tangible interfaces that helped us understand the potential for merging physical and digital interactions.

## Hardware Exercise: ESP32 & Soldering

For our project, we decided to use the ESP32 microcontroller to connect our display to an API. This required soldering the components, which was a great hands-on exercise in preparing our hardware for real-time data communication. I also made a tiny mistake by cutting off one extra pin from the long row we received hence had to add a last pin manually.

## Assignment: Getting the Onboard NeoPixel Working

As part of the weekly assignment, we had to get the onboard NeoPixel on the ESP32 working using live weather data from Jacobs. Thanks to Roopa‚Äôs awesome tutorial, I was able to:

- Connect the ESP32 to the API and fetch real-time weather data
- Program the onboard NeoPixel to display colors corresponding to different weather conditions

This exercise was really helpful for understanding how data can be translated into visual and ambient feedback.

## Concept Development

I started brainstorming ideas with my teammate Edna, focusing on the theme of overstimulation and calming routines. We explored concepts that could:

- Visualize the process of overstimulation throughout the day
- Provide a wind-down experience at the beginning and end of the day

Our goal is to create an ambient display that subtly guides the user‚Äôs emotional and sensory experience at different points in the day.
